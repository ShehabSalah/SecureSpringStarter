SecureSpringStarter is a comprehensive Spring Boot project that provides robust user authentication and authorization, email and mobile verification, password management, and more. It's designed to jumpstart your application development, ensuring security is never a concern.

With support for the latest Spring Boot 3.1.4 and Spring Security 6.1.4, SecureSpringStarter offers a solid foundation for implementing user authentication, authorization, email verification, and more, making it easier to build secure and feature-rich applications.
